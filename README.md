# TB Pneumo Detector Frontend

This repository hosts the frontend of the TB Pneumo AI Detector project, a web application designed to assist healthcare professionals in detecting pneumonia and tuberculosis from chest X-ray images using AI. The frontend is developed using React.js and includes an intuitive interface for easy navigation and user interaction.

## Project Overview

The TB Pneumo AI Detector is an AI-powered diagnostic tool aimed at improving diagnostic precision and patient outcomes in healthcare. The frontend component provides the interface for users to upload X-ray images, view diagnostic results, and manage accounts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration.
- **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload chest X-ray images for analysis.
- **Diagnostic Results**: Displays AI-generated results for pneumonia and tuberculosis detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and responsive design for an optimal user experience.
- **Account Management**: Profile settings and password reset options.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
